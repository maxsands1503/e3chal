#The Process so far

Hello person reviewing my codebase. Drupal 8 is pretty awesome and I am really excited to play around with Twig. Here are the techs I am using.


1. twig
2. SASS
3. gulp

Gulp is being used exclusively as a watcher for my build process.
When it is time for you to test, just navigate into the themes and grab everything in the 'custom' directory. The theme's name is, appropriately, "Challenge".

Thanks for your time.
